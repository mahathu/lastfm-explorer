add web frontend
    - results are updated automatically after zooming/scrolling
    - bars of most played song have the background color of the right side of that album
    - albums have a translucent gradient overlay

    - maybe use SQL?
        - potential solution: API to load data from sqlite database
    - auto update cached usernames in regular intervals
add loading spinner (based on % of sites loaded)
    - also show "last scraped track"
        - add checkbox for this feature
    - also show "estimated time remaining"
use svelte for frontend
use vis.js

extra feature:
- custom date range
    - show top 10 artists as stacked histogram, all others together as "others" (map percentage of artist per time)

- hype chart: welcher künstler hat höchsten anteil an last 100 played tracks? wann war das?
- longest favourite artist in a row
- most often favourite artist (separate times)
- line chart: fav artist volatility (by length between changes)
- change N of recent tracks considered for shorter window lengths
- one hit wonders: artists with highest percentage of top #1 hit in total plays

- use CSS media queries to only show album/artist pic when block is long enough
